## Repository Policy (Mandatory)
Follow shared rules in `../AGENT_POLICY.md`.

## Response Contract (Mandatory)

All final responses must include a concise, evidence-first summary in this JSON shape (adapt fields if not applicable):

```json
{
  "status": "success|partial|blocked",
  "summary": "short factual outcome",
  "evidence": [
    "commands/logs/files that support claims"
  ],
  "changes": [
    "what was changed (or analyzed)"
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "explicit assumptions, if any"
  ],
  "risks": [
    "known risks or uncertainty"
  ],
  "next_steps": [
    "concrete follow-up actions"
  ]
}
```

Rules:
- Do not claim outcomes without evidence.
- Keep `summary` short and factual.
- If blocked, set `status` to `blocked` and provide minimal unblocking action in `next_steps`.

## Acceptance Checklist (Mandatory)

Before finishing, ensure all are true:
- Scope addressed with explicit in/out boundaries.
